# Henry

## Objective

- Build a JavaScript app from scratch
- Associate and assimilate the concepts learned throughout the bootcamp
- Learn best coding practices
- Learn and practice GITâ€™s workflow
- Work under agile methodologies
- Enforce teamwork


## Process

This e-commerce was built by a 7 members team within a month as part of one of the final projects on the Henry academy.
During this time, we sought the best combination of assets to reach the best outcome, with the teamwork always as a priority. Each and every member on the team was able to navigate between frontend and backend tasks to strengthen their personal abilities on both sides of production.
We relied on tools such as Trello for the assignation of tasks on every sprint and managed to fulfill the objectives set for every week.

## Stack

React, Express, PostgreSQL, SASS, Passport, Material UI.


## Final outcome

By the end of this 30-day project we ended up with a fully functional website. It contains features such as authentication (including google registration), password reset, online payment methods along many others. You can find the deployed version on : https://almazenhenry-51bf6.web.app
